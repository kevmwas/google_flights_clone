This is my try to clone the google flights page. It took me roughly 10 hours working on it but i was hitting the 4 day limit.

To run the app please install the packages

```npm i```

Then run the app using the below commands

```npm run dev```

The app is bundled using the latest react and vite. The app also utilises material UI and redux for state management
